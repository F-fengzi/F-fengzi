<!-- 💬 I have the knowledge of:
  - Many many basic stuff for webdev / servers (and have not improved for years)
  - No real programming languages except for basic JavaScript before ES6 (that I learnt years ago and have not improved since then) -->

🌱 I’m currently learning... nothing!
  - 🎉
  - 🎉 Yay!

🔭 I love to immerse myself with non-realistic project plans that are going to happen at some point (this statement has not changed for 3 years).
- Fengzi Lab 2.0, a small little collection of my personal projects
- More in the back of my mind...

📫 You can reach me through:
  - Email: support@fengzi.dev (checks decade-ly)
