## Hi there, it's Fengzi! 👋

🔭 Currently planning for **Fengzi Lab 2.0**: a (hopefully) beautiful, simplistic, and easy-to-use collection of my personal projects.
  - ###### (Unfun fact: this simple thing is under planning for 2 years now and I never got to start on it due to my extreme laziness. Pain.)
  - Development blogs coming not anytime soon™

💬 I have the knowledge of :
  - Many many basic stuff for webdev / servers (and have not improved for years)
  - No real programming languages except for basic JavaScript before ES6 (that I learnt years ago and have not improved since then)

🌱 I’m currently learning, well, nothing!
  - 🎉

📫 How to reach me: 
  - Email: admin@fengzi.ga (checks decade-ly)
  - Discord: 疯子鸭#5218

⚡ However, for now, my old stuff here on GitHub:

![GitHub Stats powered by github-readme-stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=F-fengzi&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=nightowl&title_color=A44EED&bg_color=DEG,193549,000000&hide_border=true&border_radius=15&hide_title=true&include_all_commits=true)
  - Almost all repositories are currently private
  - Fengzi Music (optimized version of the open-sourced `MKOnlineMusicPlayer`)
  - Website of Jostro OS & AmogOS (the original template)
  - TypeAnything
  - Discord bots: Testie and Onebot (now public archive, I don't like this bot)
  - Coming soon™...
